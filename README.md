# Dot-Drawing
This is one of my dream projects to create. I've always liked those dotted notebooks. Square, Triangle, Etc. I would sometimes just connect and draw random dots together until I was able to form a cohesive shape that looks cool. In this project, I dream of being able to do that everytime I'm bored and I have my laptop with me and not a notebook.
